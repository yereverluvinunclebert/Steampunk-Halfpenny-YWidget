The others are the Uranus, Jupiter, Saturn and of course, 'God of War', the planet Mars. Double-clicking on the planet will cause a personalised Windows application to fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it will state as such - then it will pop up the preferences so that you can enter the command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for windows.
